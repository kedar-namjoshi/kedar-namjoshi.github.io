        Producing good software is challenging. My research develops methods to simplify program construction while providing precise guarantees of correctness and security. 
      <p></p>
	Much of my research is driven by the fascinating interplay between the deductive and algorithmic approaches to program correctness.
	
	A deductive proof method formalizes an intuitive pattern of reasoning, which can be automated. Conversely, algorithmic methods such as model checking can produce deductive proofs to certify their results.

      <h4> Research Highlights </h4>
      <ul>
	<li> <b> Parameterized Protocols: </b> <a href="papers/Emerson-Namjoshi-POPL-1995.pdf"> Cutoff theorems </a> make it possible to prove that a protocol is correct for all configurations by checking only a few small instances.
	  <p> </p>

	<li> <b> Program Equivalence: </b> <a href="papers/Namjoshi-FSTTCS-1997.pdf"> Well-founded bisimulations </a> simplify proofs of equivalence up to "stuttering," e.g., for the correctness of pipelined machines.
	  
	  <p> </p>	      
	  
	<li> <b> Abstraction: </b> <a href="papers/Dams-Namjoshi-VMCAI-2005.pdf"> Linkages </a> between deductive proofs, model checking, and abstraction lead to  <a href="papers/Conway-Namjoshi-Dams-Edwards-CAV-2005.pdf">  fast, incremental program analysis</a>.
	  
	  <p> </p>
	  
	<li> <b> Modular Reasoning: </b> <a href="papers/Cohen-Namjoshi-CAV-2007.pdf"> Divide-and-conquer methods </a> tackle state explosion in the analysis of large concurrent programs, while <a href="papers/Namjoshi-Trefler-VMCAI-2012.pdf"> new symmetry principles </a> further speed up modular analysis.
	  
	  <p> </p>
	  
	<li> <b> Self-Certification: </b>  Run-time certificates </a> formally guarantee the correctness of complex software -- <a href="papers/Namjoshi-CAV-2001.pdf">model checkers</a>, <a href="https://antonxue.github.io/papers/vmcai2021-whisk.pdf">optimizing compilers</a>, and <a href="papers/Deng-Namjoshi-RV-2017.pdf">network OS's</a>. 
	  
	  <p> </p>
	  
	<li> <b> Synthesis: </b>  <a href="https://popl20.sigplan.org/details/POPL-2020-Research-Papers/61/Synthesis-of-Coordination-Programs-from-Linear-Temporal-Specifications"> Automatically generated programs </a> coordinate groups of software agents, guiding them towards a desired joint behavior.

      I had the privilege of giving a talk on the <a href="papers/Computing-At-Bell-Labs-IEEE-Milestone-2014.pdf"> history of computing at Bell Labs</a> at an IEEE Milestone dedication ceremony at Murray Hill in December 2014.
      <p></p>

      
      I graduated with a B.Tech degree from <a href="http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/"> IIT Madras </a> and a Ph.D. from the <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu">University of Texas at Austin</a>, where <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~emerson/">E. Allen Emerson</a> was my thesis advisor. I then joined the famed Computing Sciences Research Center at Bell Labs (perhaps better known as <a href="http://spinroot.com/gerard/1127_alumni.html">Center 1127</a>), and have been here since.

      <p></p>
      As a graduate student at UT Austin, I had the good fortune to interact closely with  <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/">Edsger W. Dijkstra</a> as a member of his ATAC (the <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD09xx/EWD927.html">Austin Tuesday Afternoon Club</a>).
      His views on what constitutes good research and good writing and the example that he put forward have had a deep and long-lasting influence.
