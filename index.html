	<h4> Research Highlights </h4>
	<p>
          Developing correct and secure programs is challenging. My research is on methods that simplify the construction of programs, and offer mathematical guarantees of their correctness and security. 
	<p>
	  Much of the research is driven by the fascinating interplay between deductive and algorithmic approaches to program verification. A deductive proof method can suggest new automated approaches: e.g., using fixpoint calculations to produce compositional assume-guarantee proofs. And, on the other hand, algorithmic verification methods can be viewed as proof generators: e.g., a model checker can produce independently-checkable  proof certificates to justify why a property holds of the program. 
	<p>
	  My research includes work on 
	  <ul>
	    <li> <b> Parameterized verification: </b> <a href="papers/Emerson-Namjoshi-POPL-1995.pdf"> Cutoff theorems </a> which show that one can establish correctness of protocols for arbitrarily large network sizes by analyzing a few small instances, up to the cutoff bound
	    <li> <b> Program equivalence: </b> A <a href="papers/Namjoshi-FSTTCS-1997.pdf"> well-founded bisimulation </a> proof method that considerably simplifies proofs of program equivalence, e.g., for pipeline processors and compiler optimizations
	    <li> <b> Abstraction principles: </b> <a href="papers/Dams-Namjoshi-VMCAI-2005.pdf"> Linkages </a> between deductive proofs, model checking and abstraction, and their use for <a href="papers/Conway-Namjoshi-Dams-Edwards-CAV-2005.pdf">fast, incremental </a> program verification
	    <li> <b> Compositional reasoning: </b> Fixpoint methods for <a href="papers/Cohen-Namjoshi-CAV-2008.pdf">compositional</a> (i.e., divide-and-conquer) analysis of large concurrent programs, and <a href="papers/Namjoshi-Trefler-VMCAI-2012.pdf">neighborhood symmetry principles </a> that simplify such analysis and provide broadly applicable cutoff theorems 
	    <li> <b> Self-certification: </b> <a href="papers/Namjoshi-CAV-2001.pdf">Self-certification </a> of model checkers, compiler optimizations and network route calculations, using generated proof witnesses
	  </ul>
	  This research has been supported, in part, by grants from the NSF and DARPA.

	<h4> And a bit more ... </h4>
	Here is my academic <a href="kedar_namjoshi_cv.pdf">CV</a>.
	<p>
	  And an up-to-date list of <a href="publications.html">publications</a>; the full list is on <a href="http://dblp.org/pid/96/6348"> DBLP </a>.

	  I graduated with a B.Tech degree from <a
						   href="http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/"> IIT Madras </a> and a Ph.D. from the <a
															      href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu">University of Texas at Austin</a>, where <a
																									  href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~emerson/">E. Allen Emerson</a> was my
	  thesis advisor. I then joined the Computing Sciences Research Center at
	  Bell Labs (better known as <a href="http://spinroot.com/gerard/1127_alumni.html">Center 1127</a>), and have been here since. As a graduate student at UT Austin, I had the good fortune to interact  with  <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/">Edsger W. Dijkstra</a> as a member of the ATAC (Dijkstra's Austin Tuesday Afternoon Club). His views on what constitutes good research and the example he put forward have had a deep and long-lasting influence.
